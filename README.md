<h1 align="center">Telegram Chat Downloader</h1>

### Why this fork:
I enjoyеd the original functionality of Dineshkarthik/telegram_media_downloader
However I was missing some important features for me:
- User friendly chronology of messages
- Download everything in a single folder
- Download also message's text and caption

Actually I am not a developer, my last code was written about 10 years ago during my studies. So please don't blame me for bad coding :P
