<h1 align="center">Telegram Chat Downloader</h1>

### Why this fork:
I enjoeyd the original functionality of Dineshkarthik/telegram_media_downloader
However I was missing some important features for me:
- Accessible chronology of messages
- Download everything in a single folder
- Download also message's text and caption

Actually I am not a developer, my last code was written about 10 years ago during my studies. So please don't blame me for bad coding :P

For more descriptions and comments please visit the original project: Dineshkarthik/telegram_media_downloader


### Installation

For *nix os distributions with `make` availability
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Dineshkarthik/telegram_media_downloader.git
$ cd telegram_media_downloader

For Windows which doesn't have `make` inbuilt
```sh

$ cd telegram_media_downloader
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

All the configurations are  passed to the Telegram Media Downloader via `config.yaml` file.

**Getting your API Keys:**
The very first step requires you to obtain a valid Telegram API key (API id/hash pair):
1.  Visit  [https://my.telegram.org/apps](https://my.telegram.org/apps)  and log in with your Telegram Account.
2.  Fill out the form to register a new Telegram application.
3.  Done! The API key consists of two parts:  **api_id**  and  **api_hash**.


**Getting chat id:**

**1. Using web telegram:**
1. Open https://web.telegram.org/?legacy=1#/im
2. Now go to the chat/channel and you will see the URL as something like
	- `https://web.telegram.org/?legacy=1#/im?p=u853521067_2449618633394` here `853521067` is the chat id.
	- `https://web.telegram.org/?legacy=1#/im?p=@somename` here `somename` is the chat id.
	- `https://web.telegram.org/?legacy=1#/im?p=s1301254321_6925449697188775560` here take `1301254321` and add `-100` to the start of the id => `-1001301254321`.
	- `https://web.telegram.org/?legacy=1#/im?p=c1301254321_6925449697188775560` here take `1301254321` and add `-100` to the start of the id => `-1001301254321`.


**2. Using bot:**
1. Use [@username_to_id_bot](https://t.me/username_to_id_bot) to get the chat_id of
    - almost any telegram user: send username to the bot or just forward their message to the bot
    - any chat: send chat username or copy and send its joinchat link to the bot
    - public or private channel: same as chats, just copy and send to the bot
    - id of any telegram bot


### config.yaml
```yaml
api_hash: your_api_hash
api_id: your_api_id
chat_id: telegram_chat_id
last_read_message_id: 0
ids_to_retry: []
media_types:
- audio
- document
- photo
- video
- voice
file_formats:
  audio:
  - all
  document:
  - pdf
  - epub
  video:
  - mp4
```

- api_hash  - The api_hash you got from telegram apps
- api_id - The api_id you got from telegram apps
- chat_id -  The id of the chat/channel you want to download media. Which you get from the above-mentioned steps.
- last_read_message_id - If it is the first time you are going to read the channel let it be `0` or if you have already used this script to download media it will have some numbers which are auto-updated after the scripts successful execution. Don't change it.
- ids_to_retry - `Leave it as it is.` This is used by the downloader script to keep track of all skipped downloads so that it can be downloaded during the next execution of the script.
- media_types - Type of media to download, you can update which type of media you want to download it can be one or any of the available types.
- file_formats - File types to download for supported media types which are `audio`, `document` and `video`. Default format is `all`, downloads all files.

## Execution
```sh
$ python3 media_downloader.py
```
All the downloaded media will be stored inside  respective direcotry named  in the same path as the python script.

| Media type | Download directory |
|--|--|
| audio | path/to/project/audio |
| document | path/to/project/document |
| photo | path/to/project/photo |
| video | path/to/project/video |
| voice | path/to/project/voice |
| voice_note | path/to/project/voice_note |

## Proxy
`socks4, socks5, http` proxies are supported in this project currently. To use it, add the following to the bottom of your `config.yaml` file

```yaml
proxy:
  scheme: socks5
  hostname: 11.22.33.44
  port: 1234
  username: your_username
  password: your_password
```
If your proxy doesnâ€™t require authorization you can omit username and password. Then the proxy will automatically be enabled.
